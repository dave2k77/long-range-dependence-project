# Data Collection Protocol

## Overview
This document describes the data collection and management protocol for the Long-Range Dependence Analysis project.

## Data Structure
- **Raw Data**: `data/raw/` - Original datasets before processing
- **Processed Data**: `data/processed/` - Cleaned and transformed datasets
- **Metadata**: `data/metadata/` - Documentation and information about datasets

## Synthetic Data Generation
Synthetic datasets are generated using the following methods:
1. **Fractional Noise**: ARFIMA-like processes with different d parameters
2. **Random Walk**: Cumulative sum of random normal variables
3. **White Noise**: Independent and identically distributed random variables
4. **Trend Data**: Linear trend with added noise
5. **Seasonal Data**: Sinusoidal patterns with noise

## Realistic Data Collection
Financial data is collected using the yfinance API:
- Stock price data for major companies
- Daily frequency
- Automatic cleaning and preprocessing
- Conversion to returns for stationarity

## Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Loading**: Data is loaded from various sources
2. **Cleaning**: Missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies are handled
3. **Transformation**: Data is made stationary and normalized
4. **Quality Assessment**: Data quality is evaluated
5. **Saving**: Processed data is saved with metadata

## Metadata Standards
Each dataset includes:
- Name and description
- Data type and parameters
- Creation timestamp
- Processing history (for processed data)
- Quality metrics

## Version Control
- All datasets are versioned with timestamps
- Original data is preserved in raw directory
- Processing steps are documented
- Data dictionary is automatically updated
