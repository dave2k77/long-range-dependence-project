2. **Numerical Precision**: Fractional calculus operations have inherent numerical precision limitations
3. **Performance**: Some operations (especially JAX) may require GPU/TPU for optimal performance

## Recommendations for Production Deployment

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Testing**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/ -v
   ```

3. **Usage Example**
   ```python
   from src.analysis.arfima_modelling import ARFIMAModel
   from src.analysis.dfa_analysis import dfa
   from src.submission.model_submission import ModelSubmission
   
   # ARFIMA analysis
   model = ARFIMAModel(p=1, d=0.3, q=1)
   fitted_model = model.fit(data)
   forecasts = fitted_model.forecast(steps=10)
   
   # DFA analysis
   results = dfa(data)
   
   # Model submission
   submission = ModelSubmission()
   result = submission.submit_model(model_file, metadata)
   ```

## Future Improvements

1. **Increase Test Coverage**: Add more comprehensive tests for utility modules
2. **Performance Optimization**: Implement GPU acceleration for large datasets
3. **Documentation**: Create user guides and tutorials
4. **CI/CD**: Set up automated testing and deployment pipelines

## Conclusion

The project is now production-ready with all critical functionality working correctly. The codebase is stable, well-documented, and ready for deployment. While test coverage could be improved, the core analysis methods are thoroughly tested and reliable.

**Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY**
